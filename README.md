# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Data Analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using python, sql and power Bi
📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Workflow
📁 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle — from data extraction and cleaning to SQL querying, visualization, and reporting. The goal was to analyze the dataset, derive insights using Python and SQL, and build a Power BI dashboard supported by a professional report and a presentation (Gamma AI).

The project highlights skills in:

Data preprocessing & exploratory data analysis (EDA)

SQL querying on MySQL

Interactive dashboard creation

Business-focused insights and reporting

📂 Dataset

Source: Local CSV / Excel dataset

Description: Contains records related to [insert problem statement, e.g., customer transactions, sales, product performance]

Key Columns: [sample: Customer_ID, Date, Amount, Category, Region]

Size: [e.g., 50,000 rows / 20 features]

(Add or modify based on your actual dataset.)

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Programming

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Database

MySQL Workbench

SQL queries for filtering, grouping, joins, and aggregations

Visualization & Reporting

Power BI – Interactive dashboard

Gamma AI – Presentation deck

MS Word / Docs – Final report

🧪 Project Steps
1️⃣ Load & Understand the Data

Import dataset in Python

View metadata (shape, types, missing values)

Perform initial EDA

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handle nulls, duplicates

Convert data types

Fix inconsistent categories

Create new calculated fields

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate, bivariate, multivariate analysis

Trend & pattern detection

Outlier analysis

Visualizations for key metrics

4️⃣ SQL Analytics

Load cleaned data into MySQL

Run SQL queries for:

Filtering and sorting

Grouping and aggregations

Joins

KPI-level summaries

Validate Python insights with SQL outputs

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Import transformed dataset

Create interactive pages with:

KPIs

Trends

Filters/Slicers

Category & region insights

Design layout for business readability

6️⃣ Report Creation

Summarize the workflow

Document methodology, findings, KPIs, recommendations

Export as PDF

7️⃣ Presentation (Gamma AI)

Build a crisp slide deck

Include visuals, insights, and final recommendations

📊 Dashboard Highlights

KPI summary (totals, averages, change %)

Sales/Customer/Operational trends over time

Category and region-level distribution

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

Insight cards summarizing key findings

(Include a dashboard screenshot here if this will be on GitHub.)

📝 Results & Insights

Key outcomes generated from the analysis:

Important trend: [Insert insight, e.g., “Sales peak in Q4 driven by seasonal demand.”]

Top contributor: [e.g., “Category A contributes 42% of total revenue.”]

Customer behavior: [e.g., “Returning customers spend 3× more on average.”]

Operational note: [e.g., “40% of delays due to Region X logistics.”]

Business recommendations:

[Insert 2–4 short recommendations]
